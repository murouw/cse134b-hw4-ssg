## **DEAR WHOEVER IS GRADING THIS:**
I had a few edits past midnight because I was trying to figure out how to deploy the Netlify. Even then, I couldn't get it to work.

If it's at all possible that I get some partial credit for having the site even though I couldn't get the Netlify to work in time, I'd really appreciate it. If not, I totally understand and thank you for your consideration.
