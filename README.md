## **DEAR WHOEVER IS GRADING THIS:**
I had a few edits past midnight because I was trying to figure out how to deploy the Netlify. This can be verified by looking through the commit history and the files added. 

I really don't want to add to your workload by making you check my commits; I really appreciate the time you're taking to grade this. If it's at all possible, I'd really appreciate even partial points. Thank you for your consideration.
